The example CorDapp
===================

.. note:: The example CorDapp was previously hosted in the `cordapp-template <https://github.com/corda/cordapp-template>`_ repository. It has now been 
   moved into a new `cordapp-tutorial <https://github.com/corda/cordapp-tutorial>`_ repository. Going forward, the cordapp-template repo will contain an 
   actual CorDapp template, which should be used as the basis for your CorDapps going forward.

This guide covers how to get started with the example CorDapp. Please note there are several Corda repositories:

* `corda <https://github.com/corda/corda>`_ which contains the core platform code and sample CorDapps.
* `cordapp-tutorial <https://github.com/corda/cordapp-tutorial>`_ which contains an example CorDapp you can use to bootstrap your own CorDapps. It is the subject of this tutorial and should help you understand the basics of building a CorDapp.
* `cordapp-template <https://github.com/corda/cordapp-template>`_ which contains a bare-bones template on which to build your own CorDapps.

We recommend you read the non-technical white paper and technical white paper before you get started with Corda:

1. `The Introductory white paper <https://docs.corda.r3cev.com/_static/corda-introductory-whitepaper.pdf>`_ describes the
   motivating vision and background of the project. It is the kind of document your boss should read. It describes why the
   project exists and briefly compares it to alternative systems on the market.
2. `The Technical white paper <https://docs.corda.r3cev.com/_static/corda-technical-whitepaper.pdf>`_ describes the entire
   intended design from beginning to end. It is the kind of document that you should read, or at least, read parts of. Note
   that because the technical white paper describes the intended end state, it does not always align with the implementation.

Background
----------

The Example CorDapp implements a basic scenario where one party wishes to send an IOU to another party. The scenario
defines four nodes:

* **Controller**, which hosts the network map service and validating notary service
* **NodeA**
* **NodeB**
* **NodeC**

The nodes can generate IOUs and send them to other nodes. The flows used to facilitate the agreement process always results in 
an agreement with the recipient as long as the IOU meets the contract constraints which are defined in ``IOUContract.kt``.

All agreed IOUs between NodeA and NodeB become "shared facts" between NodeA and NodeB. But note that NodeC
won't see any of these transactions or have copies of any of the resulting ``IOUState`` objects. This is
because data is only propagated on a need-to-know basis.

Getting started
---------------

There are two ways to get started with the example CorDapp. You can either work from a milestone release of Corda or a
SNAPSHOT release of Corda.

**Using a monthly Corda milestone release.** If you wish to develop your CorDapp using the most recent milestone release
then you can get started simply by cloning the ``cordapp-tutorial`` repository. Gradle will grab all the required dependencies
for you from our `public Maven repository <https://bintray.com/r3/corda>`_.

**Using a Corda SNAPSHOT build.** Alternatively, if you wish to work from the master branch of the Corda repo which contains
the most up-to-date Corda feature set then you will need to clone the ``corda`` repository and publish the latest master
build (or previously tagged releases) to your local Maven repository. You will then need to ensure that Gradle
grabs the correct dependencies for you from Maven local by changing the ``corda_version`` in ``build.gradle``. This will be
covered below in `Using a SNAPSHOT release`_.

Firstly, follow the :doc:`getting set up <getting-set-up>` page to download the JDK, IntelliJ and git if you didn't
already have it.

Working from milestone releases
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you wish to build a CorDapp against a milestone release then please use these instructions.

The process for developing your CorDapp from a milestone release is the most simple way to get started and is the preferred
approach.

We publish all our milestone releases to a public Maven repository on a monthly basis. As such, Gradle will automatically
grab the appropriately versioned (specified in the ``cordapp-tutorial``'s ``build.gradle`` file) dependencies for you from Maven.
All you have to do is check out the release tag of the tutorial version you wish to use.

By default, the ``master`` branch of the ``cordapp-tutorial`` points to a SNAPSHOT release of Corda, this is because it is
being constantly updated to reflect the changes in the master branch of the `corda` repository.

.. note:: If you wish to use a SNAPSHOT release then follow the instructions below: `Using a SNAPSHOT release`_.

To clone the ``cordapp-tutorial`` repository, use the following command:

``git clone https://github.com/corda/cordapp-tutorial``

Now change directories to the freshly cloned repo:

``cd cordapp-tutorial``

To enumerate all the tagged releases. Use:

``git tag``

To checkout a specific tag, use:

``git checkout -b [local_branch_name] tags/[tag_name]``

where ``local_branch_name`` is a name of your choice and ``tag_name`` is the name of the tag you wish to checkout.

Gradle will handle all the dependencies for you. Now you are now ready to get started `building the example CorDapp`_.

Using a SNAPSHOT release
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you wish to build a CorDapp against the most current version of Corda, follow these instructions.

The Corda repository comprises the following folders:

* **buildSrc** contains necessary gradle plugins to build Corda.
* **client** contains the RPC client framework.
* **config** contains logging configurations and the default node configuration file.
* **core** containing the core Corda libraries such as crypto functions, types for Corda's building blocks: states,
  contracts, transactions, attachments, etc. and some interfaces for nodes and protocols.
* **docs** contains the Corda docsite in restructured text format as well as the built docs in html. The docs can be
  accessed via ``/docs/index.html`` from the root of the repo.
* **finance** defines a range of elementary contracts (and associated schemas) and protocols, such as abstract fungible
  assets, cash, obligation and commercial paper.
* **gradle** contains the gradle wrapper which you'll use to execute gradle commands.
* **gradle-plugins** contains some additional plugins which we use to deploy Corda nodes.
* **lib** contains some dependencies.
* **node** contains anything specifically required for creating, running and managing nodes (eg: node driver, servlets,
  node services, messaging, persistence).
* **samples** contains all our Corda demos and code samples.
* **test-utils** contains some utilities for unit testing contracts ( the contracts testing DSL) and protocols (the
  mock network) implementation.
* **tools** contains the explorer which is a GUI front-end for Corda.

Firstly navigate to the folder on your machine you wish to clone the Corda repository to. Then use the following command
to clone the Corda repository:

``git clone https://github.com/corda/corda.git``

Now change directories:

``cd corda``

Once you've cloned the ``corda`` repository and are in the repo directory you have the option to remain on the master
branch or checkout a specific branch. Use:

``git branch --all``

to enumerate all the branches. To checkout a specific branch, use:

``git checkout -b [local_branch_name] origin/[remote_branch_name]``

where ``local_branch_name`` is a name of your choice and ``remote_branch_name`` is the name of the remote branch you wish
to checkout.

.. note:: When working with ``master`` you will have access to the most up-to-date feature set. However you will be
  potentially sacrificing stability. We will endeavour to keep the ``master`` branch of the ``cordapp-tutorial`` repo in sync
  with the ``master`` branch of ``corda`` repo. A milestone tagged release would be more stable for CorDapp development.

The next step is to publish the Corda JARs to your local Maven repository. By default the Maven local repository can be
found:

* ``~/.m2/repository`` on Unix/Mac OS X
* ``%HOMEPATH%\.m2`` on windows.

Publishing can be done with running the following Gradle task from the root project directory:

Unix/Mac OSX: ``./gradlew install``

Windows: ``gradlew.bat install``

This will install all required modules, along with sources and JavaDocs to your local Maven repository. The ``version``
and ``groupid`` of Corda installed to Maven local is specified in the ``build.gradle`` file in the root of the ``corda``
repository. You shouldn't have to change these values unless you want to publish multiple versions of a SNAPSHOT, e.g.
if you are trying out new features, in this case you can change ``version`` for each SNAPSHOT you publish.

.. note:: **A quick point on corda version numbers used by Gradle.**

  In the ``build.gradle`` file for your CorDapp, you can specify the ``corda_version`` to use. It is important that when
  developing your CorDapp that you use the correct version number. For example, when wanting to work from a SNAPSHOT
  release, the release numbers are suffixed with 'SNAPSHOT', e.g. if the latest milestone release is M6 then the
  SNAPSHOT release will be 0.7-SNAPSHOT, and so on. As such, you will set your ``corda_version`` to ``'0.7-SNAPSHOT'``
  in the ``build.gradle`` file in your CorDapp. Gradle will automatically grab the SNAPSHOT dependencies from your local
  Maven repository. Alternatively, if working from a milestone release, you will use the version number only, for example
  ``0.6`` or ``0.7``.

  Lastly, as the Corda repository evolves on a daily basis up until the next milestone release, it is worth nothing that
  the substance of two SNAPSHOT releases of the same number may be different. If you are using a SNAPSHOT and need help
  debugging an error then please tell us the **commit** you are working from. This will help us ascertain the issue.

As additional feature branches are merged into Corda you can ``git pull`` the new changes from the ``corda`` repository.
If you are feeling inquisitive, you may also wish to review some of the current feature branches. All new features are
developed on separate branches. To enumerate all the current branches use:

``git branch --all``

and to check out an open feature branch, use:

``git checkout -b [local_branch_name] origin/[branch_name]``

.. note:: Publishing Corda JARs from unmerged feature branches might cause some unexpected behaviour / broken CorDapps.
  It would also replace any previously published SNAPSHOTS of the same version.

.. warning:: If you do modify Corda after you have previously published it to Maven local then you must republish your
  SNAPSHOT build such that Maven reflects the changes you have made.

Once you have published the Corda JARs to your local Maven repository, you are ready to get started building your
CorDapp using the latest Corda features.

Opening the example CorDapp with IntelliJ
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For those familiar with IntelliJ, you can skip this section.

As noted in the getting started guide, we recommend using the IntelliJ IDE. Assuming you have already downloaded and
installed IntelliJ, lets now open the example CorDapp with IntelliJ.

**For those completely new to IntelliJ**

Firstly, load up IntelliJ. A dialogue will appear:

.. image:: resources/intellij-welcome.png
  :width: 400

Click open, then navigate to the folder where you cloned the ``cordapp-tutorial`` and click OK.

Next, IntelliJ will show a bunch of pop-up windows. One of which requires our attention:

.. image:: resources/unlinked-gradle-project.png
  :width: 400

Click the 'import gradle project' link. A dialogue will pop-up. Press OK. Gradle will now obtain all the
project dependencies and perform some indexing. It usually takes a minute or so. If you miss the 'import gradle project'
dialogue, simply close and re-open IntelliJ again to see it again.

**Alternative approach**

Alternatively, one can instruct IntelliJ to create a new project through cloning a repository. From the IntelliJ welcome
dialogue (shown above), opt to 'check out from version control', then select git and enter the git URL for the example CorDapp 
(https://github.com/corda/cordapp-tutorial). You'll then need to import the Gradle project when prompted, as explained above.

**If you already have IntelliJ open**

From the ``File`` menu, navigate to ``Open ...`` and then navigate to the directory where you cloned the ``cordapp-tutorial``.
Alternatively, if you wish to clone from github directly then navigate to ``File > New > Project from existing sources ...``
and enter the URL to the example CorDapp (specified above). When instructed, be sure to import the Gradle project when prompted.

**The Gradle plugin**

IntelliJ can be used to run Gradle tasks through the Gradle plugin which can be found via ``View > Tool windows > Gradle``.
All the Gradle projects are listed in the window on the right hand side of the IDE. Click on a project, then 'tasks' to
see all available Gradle tasks.

* For the example CorDapp repo there will only be one Gradle project listed.
* For the Corda repo there will be many project listed, the root project ``corda`` and associated sub-projects: ``core``,
  ``finance``, ``node``, etc.

.. note:: It's worth noting that when you change branch in the example CorDapp, the ``corda_version`` will change to
   reflect the version of the branch you are working from.

To execute a task, double click it. The output will be shown in a console window.

Building the example CorDapp
----------------------------

**From the command line**

Firstly, return to your terminal window used above and make sure you are in the ``cordapp-tutorial`` directory.

To build the example CorDapp use the following command:

Unix/Mac OSX: ``./gradlew deployNodes``

Windows: ``gradlew.bat deployNodes``

This build process will build the example CorDapp defined in the example CorDapp source. CorDapps can be written in 
any language targeting the JVM. In our case, we've provided the example source in both Kotlin (``/kotlin/src``) and 
Java (``/java/src``) Since both sets of source files are functionally identical, we will refer to the Kotlin build 
throughout the documentation.

For more information on the example CorDapp see "The Example CorDapp" section below. Gradle will then grab all the 
dependencies for you and build the example CorDapp.

The ``deployNodes`` Gradle task allows you easily create a formation of Corda nodes. In the case of the example CorDapp
we are creating ``four`` nodes.

After the building process has finished to see the newly built nodes, you can navigate to the ``kotlin/build/nodes`` folder
located in the ``cordapp-tutorial`` root directory. You can ignore the other folders in ``/build`` for now. The ``nodes``
folder has the following structure:

.. sourcecode:: none

    . nodes
    ├── controller
    │   ├── corda.jar
    │   ├── dependencies
    │   ├── node.conf
    │   └── plugins
    ├── nodea
    │   ├── corda.jar
    │   ├── dependencies
    │   ├── node.conf
    │   └── plugins
    ├── nodeb
    │   ├── corda.jar
    │   ├── dependencies
    │   ├── node.conf
    │   └── plugins
    ├── nodec
    │   ├── corda.jar
    │   ├── dependencies
    │   ├── node.conf
    │   └── plugins
    ├── runnodes
    └── runnodes.bat

There will be one folder generated for each node you build (more on later when we get into the detail of the
``deployNodes`` Gradle task) and a ``runnodes`` shell script (batch file on Windows).

Each node folder contains the Corda JAR, a folder for dependencies and a folder for plugins (or CorDapps). There is also
a node.conf file. See :doc:`Corda configuration files <corda-configuration-file>`.

**Building from IntelliJ**

Open the Gradle window by selecting ``View > Tool windows > Gradle`` from the main menu. You will see the Gradle window
open on the right hand side of the IDE. Expand `tasks` and then expand `other`. Double click on `deployNodes`. Gradle will
start the build process and output progress to a console window in the IDE.

Running the example CorDapp
---------------------------

Running the example CorDapp from the command line
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To run the sample CorDapp navigate to the ``kotlin/build/nodes`` folder and execute the ``runnodes`` shell script with:

Unix: ``./runnodes`` or ``sh runnodes``

Windows: ``runnodes.bat``

The ``runnodes`` scripts should create a terminal tab for each node. In each terminal tab, you'll see the Corda welcome
message and some pertinent config information, see below:

.. sourcecode:: none

     ______               __
    / ____/     _________/ /___ _
   / /     __  / ___/ __  / __ `/         Computer science and finance together.
  / /___  /_/ / /  / /_/ / /_/ /          You should see our crazy Christmas parties!
  \____/     /_/   \__,_/\__,_/

  --- DEVELOPER SNAPSHOT ------------------------------------------------------------

  Logs can be found in                    : /Users/rogerwillis/Documents/Corda/cordapp-tutorial/kotlin/build/nodes/nodea/logs
  Database connection URL is              : jdbc:h2:tcp://10.18.0.196:50661/node
  Node listening on address               : localhost:10004
  Loaded plugins                          : com.example.plugin.ExamplePlugin
  Embedded web server is listening on     : http://10.18.0.196:10005/
  Node started up and registered in 39.0 sec

You'll need to refer to the above later on for the JDBC connection string and port numbers.

Depending on the speed of your machine, it usually takes around 30 seconds for the nodes to finish starting up. If you
want to double check all the nodes are running you can query the 'status' end-point located at
``http://host:post/api/status``.

When booted up, the node will generate a bunch of files and directories in addition to the ones covered above:

.. sourcecode:: none

  .
  ├── artemis
  ├── attachments
  ├── cache
  ├── certificates
  ├── corda.jar
  ├── dependencies
  ├── identity-private-key
  ├── identity-public
  ├── logs
  ├── node.conf
  ├── persistence.mv.db
  └── plugins

Notably:

* **artemis** contains the internal files for Artemis MQ, our message broker.
* **attachments** contains any persisted attachments.
* **certificates** contains the certificate store.
* **identity-private-key** is the node's private key.
* **identity-public** is the node's public key.
* **logs** contains the node's log files.
* **persistence.mv.db** is the h2 database where transactions and other data is persisted.

Additional files and folders are added as the node is running.

Running the example CorDapp via IntelliJ
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To run the example CorDapp via IntelliJ you can use the ``Run Example CorDapp`` run configuration. Select it from the drop
down menu at the top right-hand side of the IDE and press the green arrow to start the nodes. See image below:

.. image:: resources/run-config-drop-down.png
  :width: 400

The node driver defined in ``/src/main/kotlin/com/example/Main.kt`` allows you to specify how many nodes you would like
to run and the various configuration settings for each node. With the example CorDapp, the Node driver starts four nodes
and sets up an RPC user for all but the "Controller" node (which hosts the notary Service and network map service):

.. sourcecode:: kotlin

  fun main(args: Array<String>) {
      // No permissions required as we are not invoking flows.
      val user = User("user1", "test", permissions = setOf())
      driver(dsl = {
          startNode("Controller", setOf(ServiceInfo(ValidatingNotaryService.type)))
          startNode("NodeA", rpcUsers = listOf(user))
          startNode("NodeB", rpcUsers = listOf(user))
          startNode("NodeC", rpcUsers = listOf(user))
          waitForAllNodesToFinish()
      }, isDebug = true)
  }

To stop the nodes, press the red "stop" button at the top right-hand side of the IDE.

The node driver can also be used to as a basis for `debugging your CorDapp`_

Interacting with the example CorDapp
------------------------------------

Via HTTP
~~~~~~~~

The CorDapp defines a few HTTP API end-points and also serves some static web content. The end-points allow you to
list IOUs and add IOUs.

The nodes can be found using the following port numbers, defined in build.gradle and the respective node.conf file for
each node found in `kotlin/build/nodes/NodeX`` etc:

* Controller: ``localhost:10003``
* NodeA:      ``localhost:10005``
* NodeB:      ``localhost:10007``
* NodeC:      ``localhost:10009``

Note that the ``deployNodes`` Gradle task is used to generate the ``node.conf`` files for each node.

As the nodes start-up they should tell you which host and port the embedded web server is running on. The API endpoints
served are as follows:

* ``/api/example/me``
* ``/api/example/peers``
* ``/api/example/ious``
* ``/api/example/{COUNTERPARTY}/create-iou``

The static web content is served from ``/web/example``.

An IOU can be created via accessing the ``api/example/create-iou`` end-point directly or through the
the web form hosted at ``/web/example``.

 .. warning:: **The content in ``web/example`` is only available for demonstration purposes and does not implement any
  anti-XSS, anti-XSRF or any other security techniques. Do not copy such code directly into products meant for production use.**

**Submitting an IOU via HTTP API:**

To create an IOU from NodeA to NodeB, use:

.. sourcecode:: bash

  echo '{"value": "1"}' | cURL -T - -H 'Content-Type: application/json' http://localhost:10005/api/example/NodeB/create-iou

Note the port number ``10005`` (NodeA) and NodeB referenced in the API end-point path. This command instructs NodeA to
create and send an IOU to NodeB. Upon verification and completion of the process, both nodes (but not NodeC) will
have a signed, notarised copy of the IOU.

**Submitting an IOU via web/example:**

Navigate to the "create IOU" button at the top left of the page, and enter the IOU details - e.g.

.. sourcecode:: none

  Counter-party: Select from list
  Order Number:  1
  Delivery Date: 2018-09-15
  City:          London
  Country Code:  UK
  Item name:     Wow such item
  Item amount:   5

and click submit (note you can add additional item types and amounts). Upon pressing submit, the modal dialogue should close.
To check what validation is performed over the IOU data, have a look at the ``IOUContract.Create`` class in
``IOUContract.kt`` which defines the following contract constraints (among others not included here):

.. sourcecode:: kotlin

  // Generic constraints around the IOU transaction.
  "No inputs should be consumed when issuing an IOU." by (tx.inputs.isEmpty())
  "Only one output state should be created." by (tx.outputs.size == 1)
  val out = tx.outputs.single() as IOUState
  "The sender and the recipient cannot be the same entity." by (out.sender != out.recipient)
  "All of the participants must be signers." by (command.signers.containsAll(out.participants))

  // IOU-specific constraints.
  "The IOU's value must be non-negative." by (out.iou.value > 0)

**Once an IOU has been submitted:**

Inspect the terminal windows for the nodes. Assume all of the above contract constraints are met, you should see some
activity in the terminal windows for NodeA and NodeB (note: the green ticks are only visible on unix/mac):

*NodeA:*

.. sourcecode:: none

✅  Generating transaction based on new IOU.
✅  Verifying contract constraints.
✅  Signing transaction with our private key.
✅  Sending proposed transaction to recipient for review.
✅  Done

*NodeB:*

.. sourcecode:: none

✅  Receiving proposed transaction from sender.
✅  Verifying signatures and contract constraints.
✅  Signing proposed transaction with our private key.
✅  Obtaining notary signature and recording transaction.
    ✅  Requesting signature by notary service
        ✅  Requesting signature by Notary service
        ✅  Validating response from Notary service
    ✅  Broadcasting transaction to participants
✅  Done

*NodeC:*

.. sourcecode:: none

  You shouldn't see any activity.

Next you can view the newly created IOU by accessing the vault of NodeA or NodeB:

*Via the HTTP API:*

For NodeA. navigate to http://localhost:10005/api/example/ious. For NodeB,
navigate to http://localhost:10007/api/example/ious.

*Via web/example:*

Navigate to http://localhost:10005/web/example the refresh button in the top left-hand side of the page. You should
see the newly created agreement on the page.

Using the h2 web console
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can connect to the h2 database to see the current state of the ledger, among other data such as the current state of
the network map cache. Firstly, navigate to the folder where you downloaded the h2 web console as part of the pre-requisites
section, above. Change directories to the bin folder:

``cd h2/bin``

Where there are a bunch of shell scripts and batch files. Run the web console:

Unix:

``sh h2.sh``

Windows:

``h2.bat``

The h2 web console should start up in a web browser tab. To connect we first need to obtain a JDBC connection string. Each
node outputs its connection string in the terminal window as it starts up. In a terminal window where a node is running,
look for the following string:

``Database connection URL is              : jdbc:h2:tcp://10.18.0.150:56736/node``

you can use the string on the right to connect to the h2 database: just paste it in to the JDBC URL field and click Connect.
You will be presented with a web application that enumerates all the available tables and provides an interface for you to
query them using SQL.

Using the Example RPC client
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``/src/main/kotlin/com/example/client/ExampleClientRPC.kt`` file is a simple utility which uses the client RPC library
to connect to a node and log the created IOUs. It will log any existing IOUs and listen for any future
IOUs. If you haven't created any IOUs when you connect to one of the Nodes via RPC then the client will log
and future IOUs which are agreed.

To build the client use the following gradle task:

``./gradlew runExampleClientRPC``

*To run the client, via IntelliJ:*

Select the 'Run Example RPC Client' run configuration which, by default, connects to NodeA (Artemis port 10004). Click the
Green Arrow to run the client. You can edit the run configuration to connect on a different port.

*Via command line:*

Run the following gradle task:

``./gradlew runExampleClientRPC localhost:10004``

To close the application use ``ctrl+C``. For more information on the client RPC interface and how to build an RPC client
application see:

* :doc:`Client RPC documentation <clientrpc>`
* :doc:`Client RPC tutorial <tutorial-clientrpc-api>`

In the file structure above, the most important files and directories to note are:

* The **root directory** contains some gradle files, a README and a LICENSE.
* **config** contains log4j configs.
* **gradle** contains the gradle wrapper, which allows the use of Gradle without installing it yourself and worrying
  about which version is required.
* **lib** contains the Quasar.jar which is required for runtime instrumentation of classes by Quasar.
* **kotlin** contains the source code for the example CorDapp written in Kotlin.
 * **kotlin/src/main/kotlin** contains the source code for the example CorDapp.
 * **kotlin/src/main/python** contains a python script which accesses nodes via RPC.
 * **kotlin/src/main/resources** contains the certificate store, some static web content to be served by the nodes and the
   PluginServiceRegistry file.
 * **kotlin/src/test/kotlin** contains unit tests for protocols, contracts, etc.
* **java** contains the same source code, but written in java. This is an aid for users who do not want to develop in 
  Kotlin, and serves as an example of how CorDapps can be developed in any language targeting the JVM.

Some elements are covered in more detail below.

The build.gradle file
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

It is usually necessary to make a couple of changes to the ``build.gradle`` file. Here will cover the most pertinent bits.

**The buildscript**

The buildscript is always located at the top of the file. It determines which plugins, task classes, and other classes
are available for use in the rest of the build script. It also specifies version numbers for dependencies, among other
things.

If you are working from a Corda SNAPSHOT release which you have publish to Maven local then ensure that
``corda_version`` is the same as the version of the Corda core modules you published to Maven local. If not then change the
``kotlin_version`` property. Also, if you are working from a previous cordapp-tutorial milestone release, then be sure to ``git checkout``
the correct version of the example CorDapp from the ``cordapp-tutorial`` repo.

.. sourcecode:: groovy

  buildscript {
      ext.kotlin_version = '1.0.4'
      ext.corda_version = '0.5-SNAPSHOT' // Ensure this version is the same as the corda core modules you are using.
      ext.quasar_version = '0.7.6'
      ext.jersey_version = '2.23.1'

      repositories {
        ...
      }

      dependencies {
        ...
      }
  }

**Project dependencies**

If you have any additional external dependencies for your CorDapp then add them below the comment at the end of this
code snippet.package. Use the standard format:

``compile "{groupId}:{artifactId}:{versionNumber}"``

.. sourcecode:: groovy

  dependencies {
      compile "org.jetbrains.kotlin:kotlin-stdlib:$kotlin_version"
      testCompile group: 'junit', name: 'junit', version: '4.11'

      // Corda integration dependencies
      compile "net.corda:client:$corda_version"
      compile "net.corda:core:$corda_version"
      compile "net.corda:contracts:$corda_version"
      compile "net.corda:node:$corda_version"
      compile "net.corda:corda:$corda_version"
      compile "net.corda:test-utils:$corda_version"

      ...

      // Cordapp dependencies
      // Specify your cordapp's dependencies below, including dependent cordapps
  }

For further information about managing dependencies with `look at the Gradle docs <https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/dependency_management.html>`_.

**CordFormation**

This is the local node deployment system for CorDapps, the nodes generated are intended to be used for experimenting,
debugging, and testing node configurations but not intended for production or testnet deployment.

In the CorDapp build.gradle file you'll find a ``deployNodes`` task, this is where you configure the nodes you would
like to deploy for testing. See further details below:

.. sourcecode:: groovy

  task deployNodes(type: com.r3corda.plugins.Cordform, dependsOn: ['build']) {
      directory "./kotlin/build/nodes"                            // The output directory.
      networkMap "Controller"                              // The artemis address of the node to be used as the network map.
      node {
          name "Controller"                                // Artemis name of node to be deployed.
          nearestCity "London"                             // For use with the network visualiser.
          advertisedServices = ["corda.notary.validating"] // A list of services you wish the node to offer.
          artemisPort 10002
          webPort 10003                                    // Usually 1 higher than the Artemis port.
          cordapps = []                                    // Add package names of CordaApps.
      }
      node {                                               // Create an additional node.
          name "NodeA"
          nearestCity "London"
          advertisedServices = []
          artemisPort 10004
          webPort 10005
          cordapps = []
      }
      ...
  }

You can add any number of nodes, with any number of services / CorDapps by editing the templates in ``deployNodes``. The
only requirement is that you must specify a node to run as the network map service and one as the notary service.

.. note:: CorDapps in the current cordapp-tutorial project are automatically registered with all nodes defined in
  ``deployNodes``, although we expect this to change in the near future.

.. warning:: Make sure that there are no port clashes!

When you are finished editing your *CordFormation* the changes will be reflected the next time you run ``./gradlew deployNodes``.

Service Provider Configuration File
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you are building a CorDapp from scratch or adding a new CorDapp to the cordapp-tutorial project then you must provide
a reference to your sub-class of ``CordaPluginRegistry`` in the provider-configuration file in located in the ``resources/META-INF/services`` directory.

Re-Deploying Your Nodes Locally
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you need to create any additional nodes you can do it via the ``build.gradle`` file as discussed above in
``the build.gradle file`` and in more detail in the "cordFormation" section.

You may also wish to edit the ``/kotlin/build/nodes/<node name>/node.conf`` files for your nodes. For more information on
doing this, see the :doc:`Corda configuration file <corda-configuration-file>` page.

Once you have made some changes to your CorDapp you can redeploy it with the following command:

Unix/Mac OSX: ``./gradlew deployNodes``

Windows: ``gradlew.bat deployNodes``

Running Nodes Across Machines
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The nodes can also be set up to communicate between separate machines on the 
same subnet.

After deploying the nodes, navigate to the build folder (`kotlin/build/
nodes` or `java/build/nodes`) and move some of the individual node folders to 
separate machines on the same subnet (e.g. using a USB key). It is important 
that no nodes - including the controller node - end up on more than one 
machine. Each computer should also have a copy of `runnodes` and 
`runnodes.bat`.

For example, you may end up with the following layout:

* Machine 1: `controller`, `nodea`, `runnodes`, `runnodes.bat`
* Machine 2: `nodeb`, `nodec`, `runnodes`, `runnodes.bat`

You must now edit the configuration file for each node, including the 
controller. Open each node's config file (`[nodeName]/node.conf`), and make 
the following changes:

* Change the artemis address to the machine's ip address (e.g. 
`artemisAddress="10.18.0.166:10006"`)
* Change the network map service details to the ip address of the machine where the
controller node is running and to its legal name (e.g. `networkMapService.address="10.18.0.166:10002"` and
`networkMapService.legalName=controller`) (please note that the controller will not have the `networkMapService` config)

Each machine should now run its nodes using `runnodes` or `runnodes.bat` 
files. Once they are up and running, the nodes should be able to create 
IOUs among themselves in the same way as when they were running on 
the same machine.

Debugging your CorDapp
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Debugging is done via IntelliJ and can be done using the following steps.

1. Set your breakpoints.
2. Edit the node driver code in ``Main.kt`` to reflect how many nodes you wish to start along with any other
   configuration options. For example, the below starts 4 nodes, with one being the network map service / notary and
   sets up RPC credentials for 3 of the nodes.

.. sourcecode:: kotlin

    fun main(args: Array<String>) {
        // No permissions required as we are not invoking flows.
        val user = User("user1", "test", permissions = setOf())
        driver(dsl = {
            startNode("Controller", setOf(ServiceInfo(ValidatingNotaryService.type)))
            startNode("NodeA", rpcUsers = listOf(user))
            startNode("NodeB", rpcUsers = listOf(user))
            startNode("NodeC", rpcUsers = listOf(user))
            waitForAllNodesToFinish()
        }, isDebug = true)
    }

3. Select and run the “Run Example CorDapp” run configuration in IntelliJ.
4. IntelliJ will build and run the CorDapp. Observe the console output for the remote debug ports. The “Controller”
   node will generally be on port 5005, with NodeA on port 5006 an so-on.

.. sourcecode:: none

    Listening for transport dt_socket at address: 5008
    Listening for transport dt_socket at address: 5007
    Listening for transport dt_socket at address: 5006

5. Edit the “Debug CorDapp” run configuration with the port of the node you wish to connect to.
6. Run the “Debug CorDapp” run configuration.
