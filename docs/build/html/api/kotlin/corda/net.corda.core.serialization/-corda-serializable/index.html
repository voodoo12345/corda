<p>This annotation is a marker to indicate that a class is permitted and intended to be serialized as part of Node messaging.</p>
<p>Strictly speaking, it is critical to identifying that a class is intended to be deserialized by the node, to avoid
a security compromise later when a vulnerability is discovered in the deserialisation of a class that just happens to
be on the classpath, perhaps from a 3rd party library, as has been witnessed elsewhere.</p>
<p>It also makes it possible for a code reviewer to clearly identify the classes that can be passed on the wire.</p>
<p>TODO: As we approach a long term wire format, this annotation will only be permitted on classes that meet certain criteria.</p>
