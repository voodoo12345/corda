<p>Exposes the Parties involved in a generic way.</p>
<p>Appears to duplicate <a href="participants.html">participants</a> a property of <a href="#">ContractState</a>. However <a href="participants.html">participants</a> only holds public keys.
Currently we need to hard code Party objects into <a href="#">ContractState</a>s. <a href="../../../net.corda.core.crypto/-party/index.html">Party</a> objects are a wrapper for public
keys which also contain some identity information about the public key owner. You can keep track of individual
parties by adding a property for each one to the state, or you can append parties to the parties list if you
are implementing <a href="../../../net.corda.core.contracts/-deal-state/index.html">DealState</a>. We need to do this as identity management in Corda is currently incomplete,
therefore the only way to record identity information is in the <a href="#">ContractState</a>s themselves. When identity
management is completed, parties to a transaction will only record public keys in the <a href="../../../net.corda.core.contracts/-deal-state/index.html">DealState</a> and through a
separate process exchange certificates to ascertain identities. Thus decoupling identities from
<a href="#">ContractState</a>s.</p>
