 * A commodity contract represents an amount of some commodity, tracked on a distributed ledger. The design of this
 * contract is intentionally similar to the [Cash] contract, and the same commands (issue, move, exit) apply, the
 * differences are in representation of the underlying commodity. Issuer in this context means the party who has the
 * commodity, or is otherwise responsible for delivering the commodity on demand, and the deposit reference is use for
 * internal accounting by the issuer (it might be, for example, a warehouse and/or location within a warehouse).
 *
 * This is an early stage example contract used to illustrate non-cash fungible assets, and is likely to change significantly
 * in future.
