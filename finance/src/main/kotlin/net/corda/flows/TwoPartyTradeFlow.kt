/**
 * This asset trading flow implements a "delivery vs payment" type swap. It has two parties (B and S for buyer
 * and seller) and the following steps:
 *
 * 1. S sends the [StateAndRef] pointing to what they want to sell to B, along with info about the price they require
 *    B to pay. For example this has probably been agreed on an exchange.
 * 2. B sends to S a [SignedTransaction] that includes the state as input, B's cash as input, the state with the new
 *    owner key as output, and any change cash as output. It contains a single signature from B but isn't valid because
 *    it lacks a signature from S authorising movement of the asset.
 * 3. S signs it and commits it to the ledger, notarising it and distributing the final signed transaction back
 *    to B.
 *
 * Assuming no malicious termination, they both end the flow being in posession of a valid, signed transaction
 * that represents an atomic asset swap.
 *
 * Note that it's the *seller* who initiates contact with the buyer, not vice-versa as you might imagine.
