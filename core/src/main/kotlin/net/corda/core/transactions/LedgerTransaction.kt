/**
 * A LedgerTransaction is derived from a [WireTransaction]. It is the result of doing the following operations:
 *
 * - Downloading and locally storing all the dependencies of the transaction.
 * - Resolving the input states and loading them into memory.
 * - Doing some basic key lookups on the [Command]s to see if any keys are from a recognised party, thus converting the
 *   [Command] objects into [AuthenticatedObject].
 * - Deserialising the output states.
 *
 * All the above refer to inputs using a (txhash, output index) pair.
