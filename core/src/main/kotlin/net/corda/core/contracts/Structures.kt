     * # Discussion
     *
     * This field is not the final design, it's just a piece of temporary scaffolding. Once the contract sandbox is
     * further along, this field will become a description of which attachments are acceptable for defining the
     * contract.
     *
     * Recall that an attachment is a zip file that can be referenced from any transaction. The contents of the
     * attachments are merged together and cannot define any overlapping files, thus for any given transaction there
     * is a miniature file system in which each file can be precisely mapped to the defining attachment.
     *
     * Attachments may contain many things (data files, legal documents, etc) but mostly they contain JVM bytecode.
     * The class files inside define not only [Contract] implementations but also the classes that define the states.
     * Within the rest of a transaction, user-providable components are referenced by name only.
     *
     * This means that a smart contract in Corda does two things:
     *
     * 1. Define the data structures that compose the ledger (the states)
     * 2. Define the rules for updating those structures
     *
     * The first is merely a utility role ... in theory contract code could manually parse byte streams by hand.
     * The second is vital to the integrity of the ledger. So this field needs to be able to express constraints like:
     *
     * - Only attachment 733c350f396a727655be1363c06635ba355036bd54a5ed6e594fd0b5d05f42f6 may be used with this state.
     * - Any attachment signed by public key 2d1ce0e330c52b8055258d776c40 may be used with this state.
     * - Attachments (1, 2, 3) may all be used with this state.
     *
     * and so on. In this way it becomes possible for the business logic governing a state to be evolved, if the
     * constraints are flexible enough.
     *
     * Because contract classes often also define utilities that generate relevant transactions, and because attachments
     * cannot know their own hashes, we will have to provide various utilities to assist with obtaining the right
     * code constraints from within the contract code itself.
     *
     * TODO: Implement the above description. See COR-226
