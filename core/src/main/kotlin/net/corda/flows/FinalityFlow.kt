/**
 * Verifies the given transactions, then sends them to the named notaries. If the notary agrees that the transactions
 * are acceptable then they are from that point onwards committed to the ledger, and will be written through to the
 * vault. Additionally they will be distributed to the parties reflected in the participants list of the states.
 *
 * The transactions will be topologically sorted before commitment to ensure that dependencies are committed before
 * dependers, so you don't need to do this yourself.
 *
 * The transactions are expected to have already been resolved: if their dependencies are not available in local
 * storage or within the given set, verification will fail. They must have signatures from all necessary parties
 * other than the notary.
 *
 * If specified, the extra recipients are sent all the given transactions. The base set of parties to inform of each
 * transaction are calculated on a per transaction basis from the contract-given set of participants.
 *
 * The flow returns the same transactions, in the same order, with the additional signatures.
 *
 * @param transactions What to commit.
 * @param extraRecipients A list of additional participants to inform of the transaction.
